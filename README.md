# Smart-Farming

• Developed a comprehensive machine learning-based system integrating crop recommendation, yield prediction,
and disease detection. Utilized soil properties, climatic conditions, and crop leaf images to recommend suitable
crops, estimate yields, and predict potential diseases.

• Implemented classification,regression models(e.g., Random Forest) for recommendations and predictions achiev-
ing data-driven optimization for agricultural productivity and pre-trained ResNet50 model for disease prediction.

• Tools and Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, CNNs.
